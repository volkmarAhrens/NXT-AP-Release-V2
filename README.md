## Setup & Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- UI5 CLI (`npm install --global @ui5/cli`)

### Installation
```sh
npm install
```

### Run Locally
```sh
ui5 serve -o /index.html
```
The app will be available at [http://localhost:8080/index.html](http://localhost:8080/index.html)

---

## Data Model & Mock Data
- All data is loaded from `/webapp/model/mockdata.json` during development.
- To switch to OData, update the data source in `manifest.json` (no code changes required).
- PDF invoices are stored in `/webapp/resources/` and referenced in the mock data.

---

## Internationalization (i18n) Best Practices & Status

### i18n Binding Solution
- The i18n model is set on the Component **before** `UIComponent.prototype.init.apply(...)` to guarantee global and early availability for all controls.
- All XML view bindings use the standard `{i18n>key}` syntax for maximum OpenUI5 compatibility.
- i18n files are kept in `/webapp/i18n/` and referenced in `manifest.json` as `"i18n/i18n.properties"`.
- For fragments or dynamically created views, set the i18n model explicitly if needed.

### Lessons Learned
- Avoid `{path: 'i18n>key'}` in static XML views, as it may cause empty text in some OpenUI5 versions.
- If i18n bindings do not resolve, check for model inheritance issues, duplicate IDs, and ensure the model is available before any controls are created.

### Current Status
- **All i18n bindings are now fully resolved and displayed correctly in the UI.**
- The application is stable, robust, and ready for further development or deployment.

---

## Latest Commit Summary
- Resolved i18n binding issues by:
  - Setting the i18n model early in the Component.
  - Using standard i18n binding syntax in all XML views.
- Cleaned up test/debug code.
- Documented best practices and lessons learned for future development.
- Project is now fully i18n-compliant and production-ready.

## Language Support
- All UI texts are externalized in `/webapp/i18n/`.
- Supported: English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese
- To add a new language, create an `i18n_xx.properties` file and add the language code to `manifest.json`.

---

## Deployment
### Fiori Launchpad / NXT Launchpad
- The app is fully FLP-compatible and includes all required descriptors in `manifest.json`.
- Tile, navigation intent, and icons are preconfigured.
- Assign the app to catalogs/groups/roles in your Launchpad admin as needed.

---

## Code Style, Layout, and Naming
- All developments follow the OpenUI5 framework.
- Consistent code style, layout, and naming throughout the project.
- Inline documentation is provided in all controllers and models.

---

## Extensibility
- Modular MVC structure: `/controller`, `/view`, `/model`, `/i18n`, `/resources`
- Easy to add new features, views, or data sources.
- Ready for productive OData integration and future enhancements.
